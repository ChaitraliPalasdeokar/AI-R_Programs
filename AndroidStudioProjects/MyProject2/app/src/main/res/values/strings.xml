        12.The sum of four consecutive even numbers is 292. What would be the smallest number?\n
        ANS:70\n
        Sol)Let the four consecutive even numbers be 2(x – 2), 2(x – 1), 2x, 2(x + 1)\n
Their sum = 8x – 4 = 292 => x = 37\n
Smallest number is: 2(x – 2) = 70.\n\n
         13.A fair price shopkeeper takes 10% profit on his goods. He lost 20% goods during theft. His loss percent is?\n
        ANS:12\n
        Sol)Suppose he has 100 items. Let C.P. of each item be Re. 1.\n

        ANS:160\n

Sol)
Let the numbers be x and y.\n
Then, x + y = 20 and x – y = 8\n
x2 – y2 = (x + y)(x – y) = 20 * 8 = 160.\n\n
        16.The H.C.F and L.C.M of two numbers are 84 and 21 respectively. If the ratio of the two numbers is 1:4, then the larger of the two numbers is?\n

        Sol)Let the numbers be x and 4x. \nThen, x * 4x = 84 * 21 x2 = (84 * 21)/4 = x = 21.\n
Hence, larger number = 4x = 84.\n\n
        17.Kim can do a work in 3 days while David can do the same work in 2 days. Both of them finish the work together and get Rs. 150. What is the share of Kim?\n
